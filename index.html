                        I like things like digging into the particulars of a dataset and where it came from. I like making simple, informative visualizations. I like figuring out how to structure business systems so that people can do their best work easily.

                                I wrote this page using W3 Schools' basic <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/">W3CSS</a> framework. It is a barebones website that consists of a single file and not a lick of Javascript (except a couple "onclick" attributes). After all, I'm not a web developer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                W3.CSS's motto is "Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler," and I think that makes sense for this page.

                                    I've used Python as my go-to general purpose programming language. I’ve built simple scripts to make my life easier, utilities to access APIs and to load and transform data, and scripts to automate GIS tasks in the ArcPy library for ArcGIS.
                                </p>

                                    I am interested in learning more about performing data analysis in Python using the Pandas and Numpy libraries, and hope to find time to study this on my own soon.

                                    I've used R extensively in my work for exploratory analyses, data processing pipelines, visualizations, and dashboards. I like working in the TidyR set of packages and using ggplot2 for visualization. I've also worked with geographic data in R.

                                    At UW and Ecotope, I used R to set up data pipelines to process data from sensor networks and to build dashboards in Shiny to display real-time visualizations of that data as well as R Markdown to create dynamic reports that automatically update to include the latest data.

                                    I’ve worked with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, including the PostGIS spatial extension of PostgreSQL.

                                <p>
                                    My most in-depth SQL work was at the University of Washington. I maintained a large database that included spatial information, study participant info (including protected personally identifiable information), and air pollution exposure model outputs. I constructed complex queries to provide researchers with customized datasets. I also identified new datasets to incorporate into our database and processed them for compatibility with our system.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I led a project to build a PostgreSQL spatial database (PostGIS) in order to more efficiently store and analyze our spatial data, resulting in significantly increased efficiency in calculating geographic model inputs and therefore a quicker turnaround time for producing model outputs.

                                    The Kaufman Lab in the UW Department of Environmental and Occupational Health models air pollution and studies its effect on human health.

                                    <!--what did i do-->
                                    I worked with a large database of air quality measurements, geographic variables, and model outputs for research use. I wrote complex queries in response to researchers' requests for data, cleaned and uploaded new data, and maintained thorough documentation for data quality issues and resolutions. I gave presentations and updates on data quality issues to faculty researchers. I also worked in the field, installing air pollution monitoring equipment around the country.

                                    <!--notable takeaways/accomplishments-->
                                    I led a project to significantly increase the lab's capacity to produce geographic variables for large datasets. The application I developed eliminated a bottleneck in producing custom air pollution exposure estimates for researchers and enabled the lab to take on projects that otherwise may have been infeasible.

                                    As in any small business, I wore many hats. I managed our sales and marketing team, designed custom bicycle frames for customers, and maintained our website and internal business software.

                                    As part of the management team, I worked with the overburdened owners of the business to clarify our organizational structure and to formalize and implement procedures. With confidence that the day-to-day operations were running smoothly, the owners were freed up to focus on new opportunities.

                                    As a Quantitative Analyst, I investigated the performance of experimental building technologies. I set up IoT sensor networks and collected field data on building performance, and I developed data pipelines and dashboards to monitor experimental building systems. I wrote reports and produced data visualizations to communicate our findings.
